# Face-Recognition-Model
Due to the wide use social networks and sharing of data such as images over the such networks, privacy related concerns are getting a lot of attention of researchers.
Under that, the problem of face information disclosure is challenging and serious one, that leads to despiteful events. 
Thus, protecting the user data security in terms of facial images and still being able to use it for recognition of a user is particularly crucial.
Various methods have been proposed and developed for the protection of privacy based on the prior identification of sensitive regions of interest(ROI) such as human faces.
Scrambling helps in information hiding or information disguising, resulting in secure storage and transfer of images.
Arnold transform is one of the commonly used method of digital image scrambling, which is preferred due to its simplicity as well as periodicity in image hiding.
Finally the data is restructured into row vectors on which pixel value feature is extracted to establish a random forest (RF) model at each feature point. 
This model is further used to predict and classify any given test samples of faces.
